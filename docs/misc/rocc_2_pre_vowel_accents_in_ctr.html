<h1>Pre-vowel Accents in Chabad’s CTR</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.chabad.org/">Chabad website</a> has an edition of the Hebrew Bible
called
<a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm">The
Complete Tanach with Rashi</a> (<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>). (See my
<a href="./rocc_1_on_the_provenance_of_ctr.html">document</a>, “On the Provenance of Chabad’s
CTR.”)</p>
<p>The <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> edition distinguishes three pairs of accents using a
nonstandard mechanism rather than using the code points dedicated to making these distinctions. On a
letter with a code point for a vowel mark (including <abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr>),
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> distinguishes the following prepositives from their impositive
“lookalikes” by the logical order of an accent code point relative to that vowel:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code point <abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr> means either
<span class="romanized">deḥi</span> (!) or
<span class="romanized">tarḥa</span>&hairsp;/&hairsp;<span class="romanized">tipeḥa</span>,
depending on context.<ul>
<li>Before a vowel, it means <span class="romanized">deḥi</span> (!).</li>
<li>After a vowel (the normal order), it means
<span class="romanized">tarḥa</span>&hairsp;/&hairsp;<span class="romanized">tipeḥa</span> (the
normal meaning of <abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The code point <abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr> means either
<span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span> (!) or <span class="romanized">geresh</span>, depending
on context.<ul>
<li>Before a vowel, it means <span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span> (!).</li>
<li>After a vowel (the normal order), it means <span class="romanized">geresh</span> (the normal
meaning of <abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The code point <abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> means either
<span class="romanized">yetiv</span> or <span class="romanized">mahapakh</span> (!), depending on
context.<ul>
<li>Before a vowel, it means <span class="romanized">yetiv</span> (the normal meaning of
<abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr>).</li>
<li>After a vowel (the normal order), it means <span class="romanized">mahapakh</span> (!).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four levels of strangeness here.</p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned above, there are code points dedicated to making these distinctions. These code
points have been around since the introduction of Hebrew accent code points, in Unicode 2.0.</li>
<li>The accent-before-vowel order will be normalized away in some environments, notably, in most web
browsers.</li>
<li>The use of <abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> breaks the pattern established by
<abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr> and <abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr>, where the
impositive code point does double duty, and the prepositive code point is not used. If the pattern
were followed, <abbr class="small-caps">MAHAPAKH</abbr> rather than
<abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> would be used: <abbr class="small-caps">MAHAPAKH</abbr> before
a vowel would mean <span class="romanized">yetiv</span> (surprising but at least following the
pattern) and <abbr class="small-caps">MAHAPAKH</abbr> after a vowel (the normal order) would mean
<span class="romanized">mahapakh</span> (the normal meaning of
<abbr class="small-caps">MAHAPAKH</abbr>).</li>
<li>No font I am aware of will “understand” this encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some but not all cases, the logical order of these code points reflects a desired horizontal
visual order. Even when it does reflect a desired visual order, this visual order is very unlikely
to be achieved, except in the case of <abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> before a vowel. In all
other cases, few if any fonts will render the marks in the desired visual order, and in normalizing
contexts like most web browsers, the font won’t even get a chance to try. In detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>The code point <abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr> before a vowel means
<span class="romanized">deḥi</span> (!), e.g. to encode the <span class="romanized">segol</span>
and <span class="romanized">deḥi</span> under the letter <span class="romanized">he</span> in
<bdi lang="hbo">הֶ֭חרשתי</bdi> (Psalm 32:3) (fully:
<bdi lang="hbo">הֶ֭חֱרַשְׁתִּי</bdi>&thinsp;),<ul>
<li>Instead of ‹<abbr class="small-caps">POINT SEGOL</abbr>, <abbr class="small-caps">DEHI</abbr>›,
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses ‹<abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr>,
<abbr class="small-caps">POINT SEGOL</abbr>›.</li>
<li>I.e., instead of <bdi lang="hbo">הֶ+ה֭</bdi>, <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses
<bdi lang="hbo">ה֖+הֶ</bdi>. (The plus sign expression indicates a kind of concatenation, and is
meant to be read right to left.)</li>
<li>This is very unlikely to have the desired appearance in most fonts. Plus, in normalizing
contexts like most web browsers, the font won’t even get a chance to try. In this document’s
context, it will look like this: <bdi lang="hbo">הֶ֖חרשתי</bdi>.</li>
<li>Above I have ignored a געיה that <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> also has under the
<span class="romanized">he</span>. I have ignored it because (1) it is not relevant to the issue at
hand and (2) it is one of many “extra” געיה marks that <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> has
compared to many other editions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The code point <abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr> after a vowel means
<span class="romanized">tarḥa</span>&hairsp;/&hairsp;<span class="romanized">tipeḥa</span>, e.g.
<bdi lang="hbo">וְאֵ֖ין</bdi> (Psalm 32:2).</li>
<li>The code point <abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr> before a vowel means
<span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span> (!), e.g. to encode the
<span class="romanized">tsere</span> and <span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span> on the letter
<span class="romanized">alef</span> in <bdi lang="hbo">אֵ֝ליו</bdi> (Psalm 32:6) (fully:
<bdi lang="hbo">אֵ֝לָ֗יו</bdi>&thinsp;),<ul>
<li>Instead of ‹<abbr class="small-caps">TSERE</abbr>, <abbr class="small-caps">GERESH
MUQDAM</abbr>›, <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses ‹<abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr>,
<abbr class="small-caps">TSERE</abbr>›.</li>
<li>I.e., instead of <bdi lang="hbo">אֵ+א֝</bdi>, <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses
<bdi lang="hbo">א֜+אֵ</bdi>. (The plus sign expression indicates a kind of concatenation, and is
meant to be read right to left.)</li>
<li>This is very unlikely to have quite the desired appearance in most fonts, though the appearance
will likely be close to what is desired. In normalizing contexts like most web browsers, the font
won’t even get a chance to try. In this document’s context, it will look like this:
<bdi lang="hbo">אֵ֜ליו</bdi>. Because the two marks in question are not both below-marks, this looks
pretty close to the desired appearance. But it is still not quite what is desired.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The code point <abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr> after a vowel means
<span class="romanized">geresh</span>, e.g. <bdi lang="hbo">הַמַּ֜יִם</bdi> (Genesis 1:9).</li>
<li>The code point <abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> before a vowel means
<span class="romanized">yetiv</span>, e.g. to encode the <span class="romanized">ḥiriq</span> and
<span class="romanized">yetiv</span> under the letter <span class="romanized">kaf</span> in
<bdi lang="hbo">כִּ֚י</bdi> (Joshua 2:11),<ul>
<li>Instead of ‹<abbr class="small-caps">HIRIQ</abbr>, <abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr>›,
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses ‹<abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr>,
<abbr class="small-caps">HIRIQ</abbr>›.</li>
<li>I.e., instead of <bdi lang="hbo">כִּ+כּ֚</bdi>, <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses
<bdi lang="hbo">כּ֚+כִּ</bdi>. (The plus sign expression indicates a kind of concatenation, and is
meant to be read right to left.)</li>
<li>Although this is a strange order to encode it in, this is very likely to have the desired
appearance in most fonts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The code point <abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> after a vowel means
<span class="romanized">mahapakh</span> (!), e.g. to encode the
<span class="romanized">qamats</span> and <span class="romanized">mahapakh</span> under the letter
<span class="romanized">tav</span> in <bdi lang="hbo">אתָּ֤ה</bdi> (Psalm 32:7) (fully:
<bdi lang="hbo">אַתָּ֤ה׀</bdi>&thinsp;),<ul>
<li>Instead of ‹<abbr class="small-caps">QAMATS</abbr>, <abbr class="small-caps">MAHAPAKH</abbr>›,
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses ‹<abbr class="small-caps">QAMATS</abbr>,
<abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr>›.</li>
<li>I.e., instead of <bdi lang="hbo">תָּ+תּ֤</bdi>, <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses
<bdi lang="hbo">תָּ+תּ֚</bdi>. (The plus sign expression indicates a kind of concatenation, and is
meant to be read right to left.)</li>
<li>This is very unlikely to have the desired appearance in most fonts. Plus, in normalizing
contexts like most web browsers, the font won’t even get a chance to try. In this document’s
context, it will look like this: <bdi lang="hbo">אתָּ֚ה</bdi>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As noted above, <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>’s strange vowel-relative distinctions apply
not only to the below-vowels but also to the one above-vowel,
<abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr> code point before
<abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr> means <span class="romanized">deḥi</span>, e.g. (rendering
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>’s contents in this document’s context)
<bdi lang="hbo">אֹ֖זֶן</bdi>, <bdi lang="hbo">אֹ֖מֶר</bdi>, and <bdi lang="hbo">כָּל־רֹ֖אַי</bdi>
(Psalm 18:45, 19:4, and 22:8). But, consistent with the general sloppiness of
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>, sometimes <abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr> appears after
<abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr>, even when a <span class="romanized">deḥi</span> is (or
should be) intended, e.g. (rendering <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>’s contents in this
document’s context) in <bdi lang="hbo">בֹּ֖קֶר</bdi> and <bdi lang="hbo">עֹ֖ז</bdi> (Psalm 5:4 and
22:11). Note that <abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr> before
<abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr> is somewhat analogous to
<abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr> before a below-vowel. In both cases, the logical order does
not reflect a desired horizontal visual order, since in each case, one of the marks is a below-mark
and the other is an above-mark. Rather, the logical order reflects at most a desired horizontal
visual alignment (right-biased rather than centered) of the accent relative to a vowel-free area of
its letter. (That area being the letter’s top for <abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr> and bottom
for <abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr>). Because this is completely nonstandard, the desired
visual alignment is very unlikely to be achieved in most or all fonts.</li>
<li>The <abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr> code point before
<abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr> means <span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span>, e.g.
(rendering <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>’s contents in this document’s context)
<bdi lang="hbo">מִכָּל־רֹ֜דְפַ֗י</bdi>, <bdi lang="hbo">פֹּ֜רֵ֗ק</bdi>, and
<bdi lang="hbo">כָּל־אֹ֜יְבָ֗יו</bdi> (Psalm 7:2, 7:3, and 18:1). Note that
<abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr> before <abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr>, like
<abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr> before a below-vowel, does not reflect a desired distinction
in horizontal visual order, since both <span class="romanized">geresh</span> and
<span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span> should, visually, appear before
<span class="romanized">ḥolam</span>. Rather, the logical order reflects at most a desired
distinction in horizontal visual alignment (right-biased rather than centered) of the accent
relative to its letter. Or, if you like, you can think of <abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr>
logically before <abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr> as meaning a
<span class="romanized">geresh</span> visually <em>far</em> before
<span class="romanized">ḥolam</span>, as opposed to <abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr>
logically after <abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr>, which means a
<span class="romanized">geresh</span> still visually before <span class="romanized">ḥolam</span>,
but not so far before it.</li>
<li>The <abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> code point before
<abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr> means <span class="romanized">yetiv</span>, e.g.
<bdi lang="hbo">כֹּ֚ל</bdi> (Joshua 1:4) and <abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> after
<abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr> means <span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>, e.g. (rendering
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>’s contents in this document’s context)
<bdi lang="hbo" class="extra-letter-spacing">יֵ֘בֹ֚שׁוּ</bdi> (Psalm 6:11) Note that
<abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> before <abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr> is yet another
case where the logical order does not reflect a desired horizontal visual order, since
<abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> is a below-mark and <abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr> an
above-mark.</li>
</ul>
<p>One might naturally wonder how, on a letter <em>without</em> a vowel,
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> encodes the six accents of these three “lookalike” pairs. I.e.
one might naturally wonder how these six accents are encoded when they are “bare,” i.e. not sharing
their letter with a vowel mark.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr> code point is used for both bare
<span class="romanized">deḥi</span> and bare <span class="romanized">tarḥa</span>. This results in
an ambiguity. E.g. <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> codes the bare
<span class="romanized">deḥi</span> in <bdi lang="hbo">כִּי־ה֭וּא</bdi> (Psalm 24:2) as
<abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr>. In this document’s context, that
<abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr> will look like this: <bdi lang="hbo">ה֖וּא</bdi>&thinsp;,
i.e. it will look like a <span class="romanized">tarḥa</span>. This makes it indistinguishable, for
example, from the bare <span class="romanized">tarḥa</span> Psalm 59:5
<bdi lang="hbo">ע֖וּרָה</bdi>&thinsp;.</li>
<li>The <abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr> code point is used for both bare
<span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span> and bare <span class="romanized">geresh</span>. These
accents are exclusive to the poetic and prose systems respectively so even when these accents are
bare, there is no ambiguity (assuming we know what accent system the word belongs to). As always, it
is important to be aware that though Job is, for the most part, a poetically-accented book, its
introduction and conclusion are prose-accented. So, a bare <span class="romanized">geresh</span> in
Job could be either a <span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span> or
<span class="romanized">geresh</span>, depending on whether or not its verse is in the range 3:2 to
42:6 (inclusive).</li>
<li>The <abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> code point is used for both bare
<span class="romanized">yetiv</span> and bare <span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>.
<span class="romanized">Yetiv</span> is exclusive to the prose system so there is no ambiguity if we
know that the word belongs to the poetic system. If the word belongs to the prose system, then
<abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> is ambiguous.</li>
<li>With no pattern I can discern, sometimes <abbr class="small-caps">MAHAPAKH</abbr> is used for a
bare <span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>, as in <bdi lang="hbo">שִׂמְח֤וּ</bdi> (Psalm
32:11).</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses and abuses Unicode in strange ways that
in most environments (font, browser, etc.) will not have the desired effect.</p>
