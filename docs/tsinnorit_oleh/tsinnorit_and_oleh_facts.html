<h1>About <span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> &amp; <span class="romanized">Oleh</span></h1>
<p> <span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> and <span class="romanized">oleh</span> always appear
as part of a pair. <span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> is always paired with either
<span class="romanized">merkha</span> or <span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>.
<span class="romanized">Oleh</span> is always paired with <span class="romanized">yored</span>.
(<span class="romanized">Yored</span> looks the same as <span class="romanized">merkha</span>,
although their roles quite different.) These partner accents (<span class="romanized">merkha</span>,
<span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>, and <span class="romanized">yored</span>) behave like
normal accents, which among other things means they never appear on an initial vocal
<span class="romanized">shewa</span>.</p>
<p>Because <span class="romanized">oleh</span> is always paired with
<span class="romanized">yored</span>, in many contexts it is useful to think of them as forming a
single accent that happens to require two marks. This accent is called <span class="romanized">oleh
veyored</span>. Similarly, in many contexts it is useful to think of the
<span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> pairs as <span class="romanized">merkha metsunneret</span>
and <span class="romanized">mahapakh metsunneret</span>, although these names are not widely used.
Note that these are all somewhat analogous to the two-mark accent <span class="romanized">revia
mugrash</span>, especially in editions where the <span class="romanized">revia</span> of
<span class="romanized">revia mugrash</span> is always explicit.</p>
<p><span class="romanized">Yored</span> never appears without <span class="romanized">oleh</span>,
but <span class="romanized">merkha</span> and <span class="romanized">mahapakh</span> can appear
without <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span>.</p>
<p>Neither <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> nor <span class="romanized">oleh</span> is ever
the primary accent on its word. <span class="romanized">Yored</span> is always the primary accent on
its word, but the partners of <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> may or may not be the primary
accent on their words.</p>
<p><span class="romanized">Oleh</span> usually appears before <span class="romanized">yored</span>
but, rarely, can appear on the same letter as <span class="romanized">yored</span>.</p>
<p><span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> always appears before its partner.</p>
