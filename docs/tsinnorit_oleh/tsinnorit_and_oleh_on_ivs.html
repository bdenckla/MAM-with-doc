<h1><span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> &amp; <span class="romanized">Oleh</span> on Initial
Vocal <span class="romanized">Shewa</span></h1>
<p>The only primary accents that can appear on an initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
are prepositives. And they’re not really “on” that initial vocal
<span class="romanized">shewa</span> anyway. They’re just on a word that happens to start with an
initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. I.e., they need a stress helper in such cases.
(Whether they get that helper varies from edition to edition.)</p>
<p> Speaking of helpers: a helper for a postpostive cannot appear on an initial vocal
<span class="romanized">shewa</span>. So, we can say that no accent marking the primary stress ever
appears on an initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. This makes sense since no stress,
primary or otherwise, is ever on an initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. But what
about accents not marking the primary stress? Do they ever appear on an initial vocal
<span class="romanized">shewa</span>?</p>
<p>The answer, is yes, but rarely. In the Hebrew Bible dataset called
<abbr class="small-caps">MAM</abbr> (Miqra According to the Masorah), there are 22 cases where
either <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> or <span class="romanized">oleh</span> appear on an
initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. All the <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span>
cases and many of the <span class="romanized">oleh</span> cases are on the divine name יהוה.</p>
<p> <span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> and <span class="romanized">oleh</span> always appear
as part of a pair. <span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> is always paired with either
<span class="romanized">merkha</span> or <span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>.
<span class="romanized">Oleh</span> is always paired with <span class="romanized">yored</span>.
These partner accents (<span class="romanized">merkha</span>,
<span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>, and <span class="romanized">yored</span>) behave like
normal accents, which among other things means they never appear on an initial vocal
<span class="romanized">shewa</span>.</p>
<p> <span class="romanized">Yored</span> only ever appears as the partner of
<span class="romanized">oleh</span>. <span class="romanized">Yored</span> looks the same as
<span class="romanized">merkha</span>. (But be aware that the roles of these lookalikes are quite
different.)</p>
<p> Unlike <span class="romanized">yored</span>, <span class="romanized">merkha</span> and
<span class="romanized">mahapakh</span> can appear without
<span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span>.</p>
<p> Neither <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> nor <span class="romanized">oleh</span> is ever
the primary accent on its word.</p>
<p>To summarize, when an accent appears on initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> it is
either:</p>
<ul>
<li>A prepositive, which is not really “on” that initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
anyway.</li>
<li>One of those weird accents (<span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> or
<span class="romanized">oleh</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But what about a non-initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>? What accents, if any,
can appear on that? The answer is: none, except for a misplaced
<span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> that is seen in Psalm 32:5 ועוני in some editions. See my
<a href="./tsinnorit_in_psalm_32v5.html">document</a>, “<span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> in
Psalm 32:5 ועוני.”</p>
