<h1>Review of Chabad’s CTR</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.chabad.org/">Chabad website</a> has an edition of the Hebrew Bible
called
<a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm">The
Complete Tanach with Rashi</a> (<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>). (This edition also goes by
other similar names such as The Complete Jewish Bible with Rashi Commentary.) I suspect that
Chabad’s <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> is derived from a CD-ROM version of
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> that was a collaboration between Judaica Press and the software
company Davka. (See, e.g., the
<a href="https://www.nli.org.il/en/items/NNL_ALEPH990019164710205171/NLI">record</a> for this CD-ROM
at the <abbr class="small-caps">NLI</abbr>.) I suspect that the CD-ROM was itself derived from the
digital sources used to create the
<a href="https://judaicapress.com/collections/torah-study/products/judaica-press-prophets-and-writings-24-vol-set">Prophets
and Writings</a> put out by Judaica Press. (One problem with this theory is that Judaica Press does
not have a full Torah: only Genesis and Exodus.)</p>
<p>Chabad’s <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> is certainly the weirdest Hebrew Bible on the web,
and possibly the worst. Whether it is the worst is of course somewhat a matter of taste, and is also
somewhat a question of what purpose <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> would be put to.</p>
<p>For example, Chabad’s <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> (henceforth just
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>), though full of what most people would consider errors, might
still be correct in some cases where other editions are wrong. In other words, its very weirdness,
though usually a negative, might in some cases be a positive.</p>
<p>I will not attempt to give a comprehensive review of <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>.
Instead, I will review its <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16253/#lt=he">Psalm
32</a>. Assuming its Psalm 32 is representative of the rest of <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>,
my review should give a good idea of the quality of <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> as a whole.
At a minimum, my review is likely to give a good idea of the quality of
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>’s poetic books, since some of the issues may be specific to the
accentuation of the poetic books.</p>
<p>First, I will discuss the ways in which <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>’s Psalm 32 differs
systematically from other editions. Then I will discuss the particular (i.e. non-systematic)  ways
in which <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>’s Psalm 32 differs from other editions.</p>
<p>CTR’s Psalm 32 is restricted to the code points in Unicode 2.0. There are three code points that
were introduced later that are used in some editions of Psalm 32. In two of the three cases, the
fact that <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> does not use the newer code point causes no problems.
Indeed many editions, even quite recent ones, are like <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> in that
they do not make the following distinctions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="romanized">qamats</span> vs. <span class="romanized">qamats qatan</span></li>
<li><span class="romanized">yeraḥ ben yomo</span> vs. <span class="romanized">atnaḥ
hafukh</span></li>
</ul>
<p>(Both distinctions were introduced in Unicode 4.1, although <abbr class="small-caps">ATNAH
HAFUKH</abbr> was introduced in a way that makes its adoption difficult, even to this day. See my
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1M7-sVTuKEJLdFRDXLpOeKEjtynSTvY2EM6Lj1uK4ylA/edit">proposal</a>
to the Unicode <abbr class="small-caps">SEWG</abbr>.)</p>
<p>The third post-2.0 code point that <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> might have used is
<abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM HASER FOR VAV</abbr>, and in this case, the fact that
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> does not use it causes a problem. It causes a problem because
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> does not merely decline to make the distinction that this code
point enables. Rather, <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses a nonstandard workaround to try to
make this distinction. This workaround may work (accidentally or intentionally) in some fonts, but
not in all fonts. The workaround is to use <abbr class="small-caps">ZWJ</abbr> followed by
<abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM</abbr> instead of <abbr class="small-caps">HOLAM HASER FOR
VAV</abbr>.</p>
<p>CTR even declines to avail itself of distinctions that were available in Unicode 2.0 For example,
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> does not distinguish <span class="romanized">tsinnor</span> from
<span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span>, using only the <abbr class="small-caps">ZARQA</abbr> code
point for both. To be fair, the annotations and names of the <abbr class="small-caps">ZARQA</abbr>
and <abbr class="small-caps">ZINOR</abbr> code points were, in my opinion, botched, and that could
explain why <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses only <abbr class="small-caps">ZARQA</abbr>.
According to the annotation for <abbr class="small-caps">ZARQA</abbr>, it should be used for both
<span class="romanized">tsinnor</span> and <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> if an
above-center (rather than above-left) placement of <span class="romanized">tsinnor</span> is
desired. In my opinion this annotation encourages the use of Unicode to make a typographic choice
that should be made by choice of (or control of) the font. (See my
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1qJby64wXq9ueTUHXFlIlYdgohRFlnUqT4SkyNEFWMKU/edit">proposal</a>
to the Unicode <abbr class="small-caps">SEWG</abbr>.)</p>
<p>In several cases, <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> declines to avail itself of distinctions
that were available in Unicode 2.0, but, curiously, makes these distinctions in nonstandard ways. On
a letter with a below-vowel, <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>:</p>
<ul>
<li>represents <span class="romanized">deḥi</span> by placing
<abbr class="small-caps">TIPEHA</abbr> before the vowel</li>
<li>represents <span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span> by placing
<abbr class="small-caps">GERESH</abbr> before the vowel</li>
</ul>
<p>In a similar (and to me perverse) spirit, on a letter with a below-vowel,
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> represents <span class="romanized">yetiv</span> by placing
<abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> before the vowel, freeing up
<abbr class="small-caps">YETIV</abbr> after a vowel to represent
<span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>. On a letter without a below-vowel,
<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> uses <abbr class="small-caps">MAHAPAKH</abbr> to represent
<span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>.</p>
