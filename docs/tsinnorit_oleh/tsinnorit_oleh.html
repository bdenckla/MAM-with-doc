<h1>Tsinnorit Oleh</h1>
<p>In the Hebrew Bible dataset called MAM (Miqra According to the Masorah), there are 22 cases where
either <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> or oleh appear on an initial vocal shewa. All the
<span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> cases and many of the oleh cases are on the divine name
יהוה. <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> and oleh are non-stress-marking accents; whether they
should be considered secondary or tertiary is unclear, but they are certainly not primary. Like
geresh muqdam, the accents <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> and oleh always appear as part
of a pair, never alone. <span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> is always paired with either merkha
or mahapakh; oleh is always paired with yored.</p>
<p>These partner accents (merkha, mahapakh, and yored) behave like normal primary accents, which
among other things means they never appear on an initial vocal shewa. My point is that other than
prepositives, only weird accents (<span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> and oleh) appear on an
initial vocal shewa, and even those weird accents do so rarely, and mainly in a weird case: the
divine name (pointed, as always, as a perpetual qere).</p>
