<h1><span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> &amp; <span class="romanized">Oleh</span> on Initial
Vocal <span class="romanized">Shewa</span></h1>
<p>The only primary accents that can appear on an initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
are prepositives. And they’re not really “on” that initial vocal
<span class="romanized">shewa</span> anyway. They’re just on a word that happens to start with an
initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. I.e., they need a stress helper in such cases.
(Whether they get that helper varies from edition to edition.)</p>
<p> Speaking of  helpers:  a helper for a postpostive cannot appear on an initial vocal
<span class="romanized">shewa</span>. So, we can say that no accent marking the primary stress ever
appears on an initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. This makes sense since no stress,
primary or otherwise, is ever on an initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. But what
about accents not marking the primary stress? Do they ever appear on an initial vocal
<span class="romanized">shewa</span>?</p>
<p>The answer, is yes, but rarely. In the Hebrew Bible dataset called
<abbr class="small-caps">MAM</abbr> (Miqra According to the Masorah), there are 22 cases where
either <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> or <span class="romanized">oleh</span> appear on an
initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. All the <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span>
cases and many of the <span class="romanized">oleh</span> cases are on the divine name יהוה.</p>
<p> <span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> and <span class="romanized">oleh</span> are never
primary accents; they always appear as part of a pair, never alone.
<span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> is always paired with either
<span class="romanized">merkha</span> or <span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>;
<span class="romanized">oleh</span> is always paired with <span class="romanized">yored</span>.
These partner accents (<span class="romanized">merkha</span>,
<span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>, and <span class="romanized">yored</span>) behave like
normal primary accents, which among other things means they never appear on an initial vocal
<span class="romanized">shewa</span>.</p>
<p>To summarize, when an accent appears on initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> it is
either:</p>
<ul>
<li>A prepositive, which is not really “on” that initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
anyway.</li>
<li>One of those weird accents (<span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> or
<span class="romanized">oleh</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But what about a non-initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>? What accents, if any,
can appear on that? The answer is: none, except for one common error in which
<span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> is misplaced. In many editions, Psalm 32:5 ועוני is pointed
with its <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> misplaced on its
<span class="romanized">ayin</span> (ע):</p>

<tr>
<td>right</td>
<td><bdi lang="hbo">וַעֲוֺ֘נִ֤י</bdi></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The correctly-accented version of this word is quite typographically challenging, particularly
with the “tilde” form of <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span>. (This “tilde” form is the form
shown above.) It is challenging because the <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> contends for
space with a <span class="romanized">ḥolam ḥaser</span> dot on a narrow letter, namely,
<span class="romanized">vav</span> (ו). This challenge is also present in three words in Job (15:23,
34:37, and 39:25).</p>
<p class="center-and-spaced"><bdi lang="hbo">נֹ֘דֵ֤ד יֹ֘סִ֤יף יֹ֘אמַ֤ר</bdi></p>
<p>An analogous challenge is present with the <span class="romanized">zarqa</span> helper in 2 Sam
3:8 and Isaiah 18:2:</p>
<p class="center-and-spaced"><bdi lang="hbo">אָנֹ֘כִי֮ וּבִכְלֵי־גֹ֘מֶא֮</bdi></p>
