<h1><span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> &amp; <span class="romanized">Oleh</span> on Initial
Vocal <span class="romanized">Shewa</span></h1>
<p>In the Hebrew Bible dataset called <abbr class="small-caps">MAM</abbr> (Miqra According to the
Masorah), there are 22 cases where either <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> or
<span class="romanized">oleh</span> appear on an initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>.
All the <span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> cases and many of the
<span class="romanized">oleh</span> cases are on the divine name יהוה.
<span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> and <span class="romanized">oleh</span> are
non-stress-marking accents; whether they should be considered secondary or tertiary is unclear, but
they are certainly not primary. Like <span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span>, the accents
<span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> and <span class="romanized">oleh</span> always appear as
part of a pair, never alone. <span class="romanized">Tsinnorit</span> is always paired with either
<span class="romanized">merkha</span> or <span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>;
<span class="romanized">oleh</span> is always paired with <span class="romanized">yored</span>.</p>
<p>These partner accents (<span class="romanized">merkha</span>,
<span class="romanized">mahapakh</span>, and <span class="romanized">yored</span>) behave like
normal primary accents, which among other things means they never appear on an initial vocal
<span class="romanized">shewa</span>. My point is that other than prepositives, only weird accents
(<span class="romanized">tsinnorit</span> and <span class="romanized">oleh</span>) appear on an
initial vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, and even those weird accents do so rarely, and
mainly in a weird case: the divine name (pointed, as always, as a perpetual
<span class="romanized">qere</span>).</p>
