<h1>On the Provenance of Chabad’s CTR</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.chabad.org/">Chabad website</a> has an edition of the Hebrew Bible
called
<a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm">The
Complete Tanach with Rashi</a> (<abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr>). (This edition also goes by
other similar names such as The Complete Jewish Bible with Rashi Commentary.) I suspect that
Chabad’s <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> is derived from a
<abbr class="small-caps">CD-ROM</abbr> version of <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> that was a
collaboration between Judaica Press and the software company Davka. (See, e.g., the
<a href="https://www.nli.org.il/en/items/NNL_ALEPH990019164710205171/NLI">record</a> for this
<abbr class="small-caps">CD-ROM</abbr> at the <abbr class="small-caps">NLI</abbr>.)</p>
<p>I suspect that the <abbr class="small-caps">CD-ROM</abbr> was itself derived from the digital
sources used to create the
<a href="https://judaicapress.com/collections/torah-study/products/judaica-press-prophets-and-writings-24-vol-set">Prophets
and Writings</a> put out by Judaica Press. (One problem with my theory is that Judaica Press does
not have a full Torah: only Genesis and Exodus.)</p>
<p>I also suspect that all of these Judaica Press products, both paper and
<abbr class="small-caps">CD-ROM</abbr>, have some relation to Soncino products. In particular, I
suspect that the Judaica Press
<a href="https://judaicapress.com/collections/torah-study/products/judaica-press-prophets-and-writings-24-vol-set">Prophets
and Writings</a> has some relationship to the second edition of the Soncino Books of the Bible. And,
I suspect that the <abbr class="small-caps">CTR</abbr> <abbr class="small-caps">CD-ROM</abbr> has
some relationship to the Hebrew Bible found on the <abbr class="small-caps">CD-ROM</abbr> known as
the Soncino Classics Collection.</p>
